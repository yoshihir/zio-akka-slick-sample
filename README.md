# Original code
----------------
## zio-akka-quickstart

A [Giter8][g8] template for a basic Scala application build using ZIO, Akka HTTP and Slick!

This template integrates [ZIO][zio] with [Akka HTTP][akka-http] and [Slick][slick], so that you can seamlessly use all power of ZIO in a familiar environment of battle tested akka-http routes and slick query DSL.

It also leverages [ZLayer][zlayer] and [ZManaged][zmanaged] to build dependency graph in a very visible, type-safe and resource-safe way.

### Setting up the project

```bash
sbt new ScalaConsultants/zio-akka-quickstart.g8
# then follow interactive process to choose project name and other parameters
```

### Run tests

```bash
cd <project-name>
sbt test
```

### Launch and interact

```bash
sbt run

# create an item
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8080/items \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"name":"BigMac",
	"price": 10.0
}'

# get all items
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:8080/items
```

### Docker image

Template provides packaging as docker image out of the box, using [sbt-native-packager](https://sbt-native-packager.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) plugin.

To create an image, run:
```
sbt docker:publishLocal
```

This will create a docker image locally, named the same as your project is. You can run it like the following:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name=<project_name> <project_name>:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

### Components and libraries

This sample app has several key components:

* `ItemRepository`, which is quite a regular slick repo, with the only twist - it works with `ZIO` and not `Future`s. Backed up by an H2 database and Hikari connection pool.
* `Api` - pretty standard akka-http CRUD endpoint, also powered by `ZIO`.
* `interop` - package, where all the integration magic is happening.
* `ApplicationService` - a more higher level service, that works with different error type and uses ZIO environment.
* `Boot` - wiring all the components together using `ZLayer`.
* `ApiSpec` - akka-http endpoint spec using zio-test.

Additional libraries used:

* `caliban` for an optional GraphQL endpoint. 
* `play-json` for JSON processing.
* `zio-logging` for logging.
* `zio-config` for typesafe configuration.
* `zio-test` for testing.

### GraphQL

During initialization step, there is a possibility to add GraphQL endpoint managed by Caliban library. 
It adds two endpoints to the api: `/api/graphql` which is responsible for GraphQL queries and `/graphiql` with simple 
GraphiQL console to play with the API.

To try out this feature open the browser http://localhost:8080/graphiql

### What in the world is ZLayer?

If you're confused about what's happening in `Boot.scala` and what is `ZLayer`, please check out latest [ZIO documentation on the topic](https://zio.dev/docs/howto/howto_use_layers).
